User Stories

I want my users to be able to:

View my order history - to track past purchases and reorder favorites
Manage my profile - to update shipping addresses and preferences

View their shopping cart
Remove items
Purchase the items in their shopping cart
“Favorite” an item
View their favorite items on a “Favorite Items” page
View, edit, and update their profile page
Name, email, etc
Add payment information (credit card)
